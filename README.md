# Minesweeper
Minesweeper with interface and without interface

## V1_without_interface
It's the version made in C. This version is singleplayer and is played in terminal or cmd.

## V2_with_interface
It's the version made in C++. I pretend to do a multiplayer mode(online only) and a singleplayer mode, these two modes at an interface.

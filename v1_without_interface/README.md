## About the game
In the game the player have to choose coordinates that he think don't have mines, so he could continue playing and solving the matrix.
The player have a possibility to put a flag at any coordinate to save the place of a bomb.
After cleaning all the matrix without selecting a mine you win.

## The ouput of the Matrix
The coordinates have a number that represents how many bombs there are near that point

'#' represent places that the player haven't selected yet

'*' represent places that have mines(if you loose you can see them)

'B' represent flags placed by the player
